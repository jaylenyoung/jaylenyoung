Hi, I’m @jaylenyoung

I’m interested in a ton of engineering stuff! I'm very interested in 3D printing, and especially its role in transforming multiple industries, including astronautical engineering, which I hope to make my career. 

I’m currently learning astronautical engineering at Purdue University.
